# Tokenization Techniques in Go

This repository contains implementations of various tokenization techniques commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) including:

- Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
- WordPiece
- Unigram Language Model

These techniques are essential for transforming text into a format suitable for training machine learning models, especially in the context of neural networks.

## Overview

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or subwords. This repository provides implementations of different tokenization techniques, allowing users to understand and apply these methods in their own projects.

## Features

- Implements multiple tokenization techniques in a clear and concise manner.
- Demonstrates how each technique can be used for effective word segmentation.
- Includes example usages for each method.
